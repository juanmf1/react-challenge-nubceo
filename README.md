# React Challenge

Using a bands API, I created an app which shows every band and details from each one (including founding year, country, genre, members, and albums), where you can sort them by many factors as name, year, country and members. 

# Login 

I used Reqres Rest API, for a "fake" login. The valid data is:

Email : eve.holt@reqres.in
Password : cityslicka

# Libraries

I used :

## React-router-dom

For establishing routes and redirections

## Formik

For forms validation 

## React bootstrap

For general styles
